# skin_cancer_detection_using_CNN_model
Skin cancer is one of the most common types of cancer, and early detection is important for better 
treatment and recovery. Traditional methods of diagnosis, such as visual inspection and biopsy, can 
be slow and may vary between doctors. To solve this problem, this project presents an automated 
system for classifying skin cancer using deep learning techniques, specifically Convolutional Neural 
Networks (CNNs). The system uses the ISIC dataset, which contains thousands of images of skin 
lesions classified into nine categories. The images were preprocessed and augmented to improve 
model accuracy and balance the number of samples across classes. Four different CNN-based 
models—MobileNetV2, EfficientNetB0, VGG16, and DenseNet201—were implemented using 
transfer learning. Each model was trained and tested using evaluation metrics like accuracy, 
precision, recall, and AUC to find out which one performed best.
